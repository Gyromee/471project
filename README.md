We are using Python3, as the server type "python Server.py <portNumber>",
then as the client type "python Client.py <serverAddress> <portNumber>"
"ftp> get <file name>" or,
"ftp> put <filename>" or,
"ftp> ls" or,
"ftp> quit".

Commands sent from client to server have a "?" prepended to the commands as to not confuse them with Python3 keywords.
